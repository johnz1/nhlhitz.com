		Since 2009, I have run an organized NHL Hitz 20-02 league.  We exclusively play the game with six players.  We have in-person tournaments, stat tracking, a physical and web-based soundboard, and game hacks for true widescreen and a variety of custom graphics.  Until 2021, we played in-person.  Starting in 2022, we have played online with PCSX2 and Parsec on a cloud-hosted gaming server.
		<br>
		<br>
		Our server is in New York.  If you live anywhere near the northeast region of the US and you want to play HITZ online with us, tweet us @nhlhitz2002 and ask for an invite.
